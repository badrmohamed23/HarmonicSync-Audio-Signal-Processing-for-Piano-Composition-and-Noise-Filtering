This project involves creating a musical composition by generating and combining piano notes from the 3rd and 4th octaves, simulating a pianist playing with both hands simultaneously. The generated signal is then subjected to noise addition, where unwanted sinusoidal components are introduced randomly. Using frequency domain analysis, the noise is identified and filtered out, resulting in a restored, clean audio signal. The project demonstrates fundamental concepts of signal generation, superposition, noise analysis, and frequency-based filtering, providing hands-on experience in audio processing using Python.
